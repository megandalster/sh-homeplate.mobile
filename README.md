This is the android app that runs an Android tablet on the Second Helpings trucks.
It shares data via ftp with sh-homeplate, a web-based app that managaes the
Second Helpings database and daily schedule of pick-ups and drop-offs.

The original version was developed in 2012 at Bowdoin College by 3 students and
a professor.  The current version was developed from the original by Progressive 
Technology, Inc from 2014-2017, and then handed over to NPFI which maintains it.
